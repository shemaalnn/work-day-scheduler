# Work-day-scheduler
Week 5 Challenge to build a work day calendar 

## Description 

The work day scheduler is created to keep track of daily tasks and to keep an individual organised. I was given a starter code to work with that provided some basic html and css, whilst I worked mainly on the javascript and functionality. This project included the use of Third Party APIs such as Day.js and Jquery. 

## User Story

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria

THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
